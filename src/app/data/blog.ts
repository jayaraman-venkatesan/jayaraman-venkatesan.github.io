      "Today I was trying to solve some leetcode and found how helpful the leetcode community is. Binary search if learnt properly is such a simple concept, but the places where we can apply it has no bounds. I was trying to solve a problem 'Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days' and came across a beautiful writeup by a random person on how to approach binary search problems. It had a template that can be used to solve any binary search problem. I was amazed by the simplicity of the template and how it can be applied to solve any binary search problem.Today I was trying to solve some leetcode and found how helpful the leetcode community is.

    summary:
      "Unparalled writing. The poetic masterclass. The book is a retelling of the Iliad from the perspective of Patroclus. The book is a blend of romance, war, and mythology. Every line is carefully sculpted to give the feel of reading a poem. The way the author has portrayed the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time",

    summary:
      "One of the few books that I would genuienly like to re-read. It is a book that makes you think about your life choices and the impact of those choices. The story travels seamlessly between parallel universes letting the protagonist's experience how the life would have been if she made different choices, making her realize the importance of living in the present. I would say it is a must-read for anyone who is looking for a book that is both thought-provoking and heartwarming.",
