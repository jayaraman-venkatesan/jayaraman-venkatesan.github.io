export const summary = [`In the vast coding cosmos, I wear the Bug Zapper cape, armed with a keyboard and humor sharper than a syntax error. Debugging is my stand-up routine; I once told a bug, "Why did the programmer go broke? Too many cache misses!" It didn't fix the bug, but laughter echoed in the code cave. Bugs now submit feature requests, hoping for a comedic touch before their squashing.`,
`Beyond laughs, I'm a coding sorcerer who tamed Spring Boot and Kotlin at Visa. I juggled metrics, mentored new hires, and had my code nominated for a compiler standing ovation. I also champion social good, fighting digital exploitation in supply chains. Here's to laughter, bug zapping, and weaving coding spells in the ever-evolving tech universe!`]
